# JavaScript: Password Generator

## Thought Process
I began by writing out my pseudo code, and typing in the script tags between the body tags. 
I decided to start my coding by making sure that no alerts would pop up unless the generate button was clicked.
I started to create the promps, and made sure they popped up one after another.
I created variables, and attatched it to the prompts. This was my first step in my attempt to save the users inputs.
I then added conditional statements (if, else if, and else) that responded accordingly to the users response.
After finishing the statements, I began creating functions to randomly generate:
- upper case letters
- lower case letters
- numbers
- symbols
